# kids-event-planner

## Purpose
Application goal is to enable kids event planning. When you plan to go somewhere with your kid then you can publish event to your friends. They can join your event.
You can also schedule some after school activity.

## Architecture
To write the application I use hexagonal architecture (also known as port and adapters).
